# Operating Systems Multithreading Workshop

This repository contains practical implementations of classic synchronization problems in computer science. These examples were developed for the **Operating Systems (OS)** course workshop to demonstrate concepts such as **Race Conditions**, **Deadlocks**, **Semaphores**, and **Monitors**.

## 📂 Contents

1.  **Producer-Consumer Problem**: Solved using `Condition Variables` to manage buffer states.
2.  **Readers-Writers Problem**: Implemented using `Mutex Locks` to ensure data consistency.
3.  **Dining Philosophers Problem**: Solved using the **Resource Hierarchy** solution to prevent Deadlocks.
4.  **Sleeping Barber Problem**: Implemented using `Semaphores` to coordinate customer and barber interactions.

## 🛠 Technology Stack

* **Language**: Python 3.x
* **Library**: `threading` (Standard Library)
